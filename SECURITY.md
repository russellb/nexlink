# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Nexodus project maintains no release branches. We run our services off of the `main` branch, so that is the only supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities may be reported privately via [GitHub](https://github.com/nexodus-io/nexodus/security/advisories). For more information about privately reporting security issues via GitHub, see the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
